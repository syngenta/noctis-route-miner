# Toy Data Set
the toy mode is an exemplary data set representing a prototype Synthetic Tree containing 4 different chemical routes  
The shape (nodes and connectivity) is the same across the different cases, but the node and edge labels are different to test the flexibility of the plugin with respect to the lable names


# Test Data Set  
The test data set is constructed from public reaction data extracted from patents and made available

In the experiments we use two open-source datasets derived from the Lowe dataset and curated by MIT and later used by IBM.
