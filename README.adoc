# Noctis Route Miner

Noctis Route Miner is part of the Noctis publication. In this repository, you will find a tool designed to extract all possible synthetic routes from a reaction network. Consider a chemical network consisting of chemical equations (reactions) and molecules (compounds). In this network, a molecule produced by one reaction might serve as an ingredient for another reaction. A "route" is defined as a sufficient subgraph required to produce a given compound. The algorithm uses a breadth-first search approach to systematically mine routesâ€”from the target compound to the starting materials. The tool is implemented as a Java plugin and is accessible via a dedicated Neo4j query either directly through Neo4j Desktop or through Noctis. For more details about the design and workflow, we invite you to read the article.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

## Project Setup

This project is a Java library built with Gradle, designed to work with Neo4j.

### Dependencies

- Neo4j Kernel 5.14.0
- JUnit Jupiter 5.8.2 (testing)
- Neo4j Harness 5.14.0 (testing)
- Mockito Core 4.3.0 (testing)

## Installation

### Using the Compiled JAR

**Download the Latest Release:** 
  
Grab the latest JAR file from the Releases page.

**Install in Neo4j:**  
  
- Drop the JAR file into your Neo4j plugins folder.  
- Restart your Neo4j database.

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build the project yourself:

**Clone the Repository:**
----
$ bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/noctis-route-miner.git
cd noctis-route-miner
----

**Build with Gradle (Windows Example):**
----
$ bash
.\gradlew build
----
This will compile the project and produce the JAR file for use.

## Usage  
After installation, you can use the following Cypher query to invoke the route extraction functionality:

**Directly through Neo4j Desktop:**
----
$ cypher
MATCH (my_target {uid: UID1})
CALL noctis.route.miner(
  my_target, 
  'Molecule', 
  'ChemicalEquation', 
  '<REACTANT', 
  '<PRODUCT', 
  {maxNumberReactions: 4, nodesStopProperty: 'this_is_a_stop_property'}
)
YIELD relationships
----
Replace the MATCH statement with any other query to fetch the desired molecule, and adjust node labels, relationship types, and parameters as needed. 

**Through NOCTIS:**

----
$ python

repo = Neo4jRepository(uri=YOUR_URI, username=USER, password=SECUREPASSWORD, database=DB)
routes = repo.execute_query('get_route', root_node_uid="UID1", max_number_reactions=7, node_stop_property='REDFLAG')

----
For more details, we invite you to check NOCTIS repo or the publication. 

**Attention!!!**: A uid property is required on all Molecule and ChemicalEquation nodes for the algorithm to run correctly.
